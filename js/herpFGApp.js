			factB: "Together with crocodiles, alligators are descended from reptiles that lived between 225 and 65 million years ago.",

			food: "Berries, Plants, Worms, and Snails",
			factA: "Box turtles are active in the morning and after rain. In hot, dry weather, they burrow in mud or look for shade. Although their ability to completely enclose their head, limbs, and short tail helps them against predators, it doesn't help them survive passing cars. These gentle turtles make good pets.",

			factA: "Bullfrogs rarely leave the water except in very wet weather. These large frogs usually pounce on their prey but have been known to snatch unsuspecting swallows from the air. Bullfrogs will eat anything they can catch and swallow, including their own young.",
			factB: "Bullfrogs hibernate in soft mud on the bottom of ponds and lakes.",

			factA: "These distinctive snakes have hourglass-shaped dark crossbands that enclose lighter areas. The young have a bright yellow tail that they wave to attract food. Copperheads bask in the sun during the day in spring and fall, becoming nocturnal as the days grow warmer. Copperhead bites hurt, but rarely are life-threatening.",

			food: "Insects & Other Lizards",
			factA: "The fence lizard lives in warmer regions and controls their body temperature by basking, then burrowing or lying in the shade. Some use special tricks like flattening the body to warm up quickly or hopping from foot to foot to keep their toes from burning on hot desert sand. If a lizard's tail breaks off, the broken piece wiggles for several minutes. A new, shorter tail will grow back in its place.",

			factA: "These highly poisonous snakes are known for the rattle at the end of their tails. Interlocking links with loose scales inside form the rattle. A new link is added each time the snake sheds, but due to wear and tear, segments don't help in determining age.",

			factA: "Skinks bask on logs and stumps, changing position frequently. They like old sawdust and brush piles and dead leaves. A courting male rushes aroud open-mouthed toward another skink. If the lizard attacks back, it's a male. If it runs away or stays still, it's a female. These agile lizards can slip through fingers easily.

			factA: "Unlike box turtles, snapping turtles are vicious predators and will lunge at humans when on land. These large turtles can badly maul a person's hand. They live in muddy ponds, lakes and rivers, and attract fish to eat by wriggling their tongue's two wormlike tips. Snapping turtles actively seek prey at night. By day they may lie on the bottom where their head can reach air for breathing.",
