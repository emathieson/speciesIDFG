The American elm occurs naturally in an assortment of habitats, most notably rich bottomlands, floodplains, stream banks, and swampy ground, although it also often thrives on hillsides, uplands and other well-drained soils.",
			wildlife:"The American elm is highly susceptible to Dutch elm disease and elm yellows. Although intensive feeding by elm bark beetles can kill weakened trees, their main impact is as vectors of Dutch Elm disease. American elm is also moderately preferred for feeding and reproduction by the adult elm leaf beetle, and highly preferred for feeding by the Japanese beetle.",
			image: src="./trees/img/alder.jpg",
			factA: "The elm's seeds are largely wind-dispersed, and the tree grows quickly and begins bearing seeds at a young age.  Elms have been able to survive and to reproduce in areas where the disease had eliminated old trees, although most of these young elms eventually succumb to the disease at a relatively young age."};

The leaves are browsed by white tailed deer,[6] although they are not a preferred food. Squirrels benefit this species by distributing and burying the seeds; if the seeds are not reclaimed by the squirrel, they will germinate and help disperse the species. Black walnut is also allelopathic, which means that it releases chemicals from roots and other tissues that harm some other organisms and give the tree a competitive advantage; this is often undesirable as it can harm garden plants and grasses.",
			image: src="./trees/img/alder.jpg",
			factA: "Black walnut is primarily a pioneer species similar to red and silver maple and black cherry. Because of this, black walnut is a common weed tree found along roadsides, fields, and forest edges in the eastern US. It will grow in closed forests, but is classified as shade intolerant, this means it requires full sun for optimal growth and nut production."};
